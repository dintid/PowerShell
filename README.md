# PowerShell Security & AD Hardening Scripts

Collection of PowerShell scripts used for Active Directory auditing,
hardening, and PingCastle-related findings.

## Folder naming
- A-* = Audit
- S-* = Security / State checks
- P-* = Privilege / Path issues
- T-* = Task / Tooling

Each folder contains a single self-contained script.

## Notes
- Scripts are written for Windows PowerShell 5.1
- Output folders/logs are intentionally gitignored
